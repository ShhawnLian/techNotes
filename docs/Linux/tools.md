## `ps2pdf`

### reduce pdf file size

It can be used to reduce the pdf size. 

Generally, there are two major reasons why PDF file size can be unexpectedly large (refer to [Understanding PDF File Size](https://www.evermap.com/PDFFileSize.asp)).

- one or more fonts are stored inside PDF document.
- using images for creating PDF file.

I just got a large non-scanned pdf with size 136M, and it probably is due to many embedded fonts which can be checked in the properties.

Then I tried the command `ps2pdf` mentioned in [Reduce PDF File Size in Linux](https://www.journaldev.com/34668/reduce-pdf-file-size-in-linux), the file size is significantly reduced, only 5.5M!

```bash
$ ps2pdf -dPDFSETTINGS=/ebook Puntanen2011_Book_MatrixTricksForLinearStatistic.pdf Puntanen2011_Book_MatrixTricksForLinearStatistic_reduced.pdf
