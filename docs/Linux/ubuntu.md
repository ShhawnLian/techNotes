## no "new document" in right click menu

Surprisingly, no "new document" in the right-click menu on Ubuntu 18.04, then I found the [post](https://itsfoss.com/add-new-document-option/) which also mentioned this inconvenience, and it gives a wonderful solution. Use `Templates`!! Never use this folder before!

Just create an empty file, say `README.md`, then there will be a `New Document` in the right-click menu.

Also check the [official documentation](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/files-templates.html.en) on `Templates`

> A file template can be a document of any type with the formatting or content you would like to reuse.
